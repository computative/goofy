- A handful of small systems were investigated 'by hand'
    * I can see all the parameters: the rmse, coefficients, design matrix plot, response vector plot, the ace-bonds
      the atomic positions
- When the bonds are the same, regardless of the width of the material, the rmse residuals are the same
    * So the results are only different when the ace-bonds are different
- I calculate the same atoms between two materials
    * I see the usual performance discrepancy
- The design matrices, response vector: of course there are more short ace-bonds: 2.81 vs 3.71
    * the rmse of the fitted values are 0.83 vs 3e-2.
    * the rmse of the residuals are     4e-2 vs 2e-8.  
    * How can we know that there should be a linear relation between these?  




ace-bond 0.83    3e-2
RMSE     4e-2    2e-8
